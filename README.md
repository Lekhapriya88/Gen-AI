# Semantic Search
Overview

In today's fast-paced business environment, solutioners are challenged by the need to quickly understand and respond to RFPs. The RFP Analyzer, enhanced with our Generative AI Semantic Search Engine, provides a sophisticated solution to identify straightforward requirements and recognize gaps in proposed products, services, and components.

##Problem Statement

Sanjay, a solutioner, faces the challenge of responding to a complex RFP within a tight deadline. The technical areas required are obscure, and the team's knowledge is somewhat outdated. This scenario necessitates a high-quality solution that is both timely and accurate.

Solution

The RFP Analyzer is now powered by a GenAI-based tool, integrating our Generative AI Semantic Search Engine. This tool can be installed on a solutioner's workstation, enabling Sanjay and his team to run Natural Language queries based on the RFP. It provides insights into the feasibility of potential solution components, identifies gaps, and prioritizes efforts to address these gaps.

Demonstration

An RFP for a sustainability solution is received. The solutioner plans to base the response on Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability. The RFP Analyzer, with its enhanced semantic search, will demonstrate how to extract and interpret queries from the RFP.

Architecture of RFP Analyzer

The architecture integrates the Generative AI Semantic Search Engine into the RFP Analyzer. Documents related to the solution components are ingested into a vector database. The GenAI tool, using OpenAI public models, allows for NL querying of these documents.

Snapshots Demonstrating Usage

Query 1: "Does the system read Arabic data?"
The query is based on requirement 2.4.1 of the RFP, targeting the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability database. The response showcases the system's capability.
Query 2: "What other languages can be supported?"
Query 3: "Need to migrate current data into the system."
Query 4: "Capability to retain past yearsâ€™ data (up to 5 years)."
Quality of Responses
The enhanced RFP Analyzer was tested with various queries from the RFP, demonstrating high-quality, accurate responses, supporting its utility in RFP analysis.

Deployment of RFP Analyzer for Sustainability

Instructions for deploying the RFP Analyzer, including the ingestion of relevant documents and setup of the query environment, are provided. The tool is adaptable to various domains, ensuring wide applicability.
